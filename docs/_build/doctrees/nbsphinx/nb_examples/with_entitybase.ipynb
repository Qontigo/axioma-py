    "The following examples illustrate the functionality and usage of the base classes in constructing classes to represent API entities.\n",
    "Unless contributing to the package this should be considered for information only and is not required to follow any other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the axiomapy package is to provide a set of classes and associated methods to faciliate working with REST API.\n",
    "The intended benefits and goals of this package are:  \n",
    "* to provide a more intuitive interface for users less familiar with the API to increase usage  \n",
    "* allow developers to work with json/dict representations interchangeably with instances where more convient  \n",
    "* improve the developer and API user's experience  \n",
    "* reduce dependancy on external documentation  \n",
    "* package more boiler plate code to reduce time to build applications  \n",
    "* include comprehesive examples/tutorials on usage  \n",
    "* include examples/art of the possible to help business users leverage the API or better understand the benefit  \n",
    "* be easy to collaborate on  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functional requirements of the package are \n",
    "* to have classes that capture the models of the API  \n",
    "* supported nested models   \n",
    "* move from the class instances to the dict representations passed or returned by the API and vice versa seamlessly.  \n",
    "* support core user requirements; cloning, updating etc  \n",
    "* provide a developer experience consistent with the language requirements - e.g. snake casing/PEP8 etc  \n",
    "\n",
    "A series of 'abstract' base classes are used to provide this core functionality and should be sub-classed when creating an API model class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture/Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The sdk design has 4 distinct elements:  \n",
    "1. Session: Manages all http requests to the remote app and triggers serialisation/deserialisation. Leverages requests Session and so can use existing connection pools etc.   \n",
    "2. Context Manager: manages switching sessions between contexts (i.e. with blocks)  \n",
    "3. Axiomaapi: Interface to the RESTful API via the current Session  \n",
    "4. Entities: All the data models and methods associated with working with the remote resources. Any actions on resource resources are handled by the axioma api classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "For functional usage of the session/context refer to: [with_axiomaapi](./with_axiomaapi.ipynb)  \n",
    "For functional usage axiomaapi refer to: [with_sessions](./with_sessions.ipynb)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this notebook considers the entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various base classes, there are code examples of each below:  \n",
    "* EnumBase - provides features for enumerations such as creation from strings, case insensitivty etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* CommonBase - Represents serialisable classes that are also cloneable.  \n",
    "    * Used for classes that do not need to initialise directly from a response but should serialise as part of a request.   \n",
    "    * For example used as a base class in collections where the collection is initialised from an iterable of representations rather than directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* EntityBase(CommonBase) - apart from collections all classes subclass this abstract class.  \n",
    "    * Provides methods to serialise to and from dict  \n",
    "    * Provides methods to update/replace contents \n",
    "    * Provides dict like methods (get, update) and property/attribute access instance\\['property'\\], instance.property  \n",
    "    * Interrogates the subclass property's type hints to manage nested entities and special data types when serialising  \n",
    "    * Handles translation between datamodel naming conventions (camel case) to python/PEP8 (snake case)  \n",
    "\n",
    "* TemplatedEntityBase(EntityBase) - used for represent entities that are presented via templates  \n",
    "    * supports an explit mapping between class properties and the data model (template) \n",
    "    * supports direct access to the content attributes from the upper level class  \n",
    "\n",
    "* EntityCollectionBase - a common base class for collections of entities arguably redundant  \n",
    "\n",
    "* EntitySequence(MutableSequence\\[T\\], EntityCollectionBase) - Represents a non-keyed/mapped set of entities e.g. Identifiers  \n",
    "\n",
    "* EntityMapping(MutableMapping\\[str, T\\], EntityCollectionBase) - Represents a dict like mapping of entities e.g. Portfolios  \n",
    "\n",
    "Collections of entities could be managed reasonable easily with a simple list/dict but this would not support class methods\n",
    "However, since there value is not as great as other base classes they attempt to work interchangeably with list/tuple etc.\n"
