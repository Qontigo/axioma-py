**axioma-py** is a Python software development kit (SDK) created for Qontigo's API clients and partners. It is a set of Python wrappers for our Axioma REST API that provide easy access to its Axioma Risk&trade; endpoints. It supports Python versions 3.6 and above. This Python-based SDK is an alternative to working directly with the endpoint/JSON structure used in the native REST API. It provides users with the flexibility, speed, and on-the-fly processing common to Python programming and can be used to enable and accelerate the development of applications for systems and data integration with Qontigo products as well as perform advanced analytics. Information needed to run each endpoint is provided in the wrapper code and in the compiled online manual, along with examples.
