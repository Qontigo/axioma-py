**axioma-py**  is a Python software development kit (SDK) created for Qontigo's API clients and partners. It is a set of Python wrappers for our Axioma REST API that provide easy access to its Axioma Riskâ„¢ endpoints. It supports Python versions 3.6 and above. This Python-based SDK is an alternative to working directly with the endpoint/JSON structure used in the native REST API. It provides users with the flexibility, speed, and on-the-fly processing common to Python programming and can be used to enable and accelerate the development of applications for systems and data integration with Qontigo products as well as perform advanced analytics. Information needed to run each endpoint is provided in the wrapper code and in the compiled online manual, along with examples. Qontigo/axioma-py is licensed under Apache License 2.0.

axioma-py was originally written, maintained and used by internal Qontigo users. We now want to invite our clients to use this code and share in its further development. axioma-py is not a Qontigo supported product. Nor is it a comprehensive SDK for our REST API, but it will provide those conversant in Python with a strong starting point. All are welcome to provide feedback and contribute to its development.
