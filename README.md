# Welcome to axioma-py! 
## Qontigo’s open-source software for our API users


Thank you for your interest in our project. We are excited to share it with you and hear your feedback.


**axioma-py** is a Python software development kit (SDK) created for Qontigo's API clients and partners. It is a set of Python wrappers for our Axioma REST API that provide easy access to its Axioma Risk&trade; endpoints. It supports Python versions 3.6 and above. This Python-based SDK is an alternative to working directly with the endpoint/JSON structure used in the native REST API. It provides users with the flexibility, speed, and on-the-fly processing common to Python programming and can be used to enable and accelerate the development of applications for systems and data integration with Qontigo products as well as perform advanced analytics. Information needed to run each endpoint is provided in the wrapper code and in the compiled online manual, along with examples.  Qontigo/axioma-py is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](Apache} 

axioma-py was originally written, maintained and used by internal Qontigo users. We now want to invite our clients to use this code and share in its further development. axioma-py is not a Qontigo supported product. Nor is it a comprehensive SDK for our REST API, but it will provide those conversant in Python with a strong starting point. All are welcome to provide feedback and contribute to its development.

# Features 

* This package contains a set of classes and associated methods that help business users leverage Qontigo's Axioma REST API and better understand its benefits. 
* It provides a development platform that is easy for anyone conversant in Python to pick up and collaborate on. 
* The downloadable package comes with comprehensive examples and tutorials on the usage of this Python-based SDK.  
* The extensive boilerplate and example code will likely reduce the time it takes to build custom applications leveraging the API. 
* Basic examples demonstrate how to build wrappers around some of the most frequently used endpoints and these can also be used as a template for writing your own custom wrappers.
* This package also helps reduce dependence on other REST API documentation, such as Swagger.



## Basic Requirements

* Python 3.6 or greater
* Access to PIP package manager 


## Optional Requirements

* To work with and contribute to documentation, you will need Sphinx.


##  How To Contribute 

Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) document. It contains answers to general questions about contributing. If you are ready to work on this project, jump to the [Installation and Setup](INSTALLING.md) document. We also have a standard GitHub [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we request all users and contributors follow.  



## Documentation

Unformatted documentation and examples can be accessed directly on the GitHub website [here, in the html folder](docs/_build/html), should you want to browse it before downloading the project. (In the similar directory of an offline git repository, the manual pages will be formatted) The axioma-py package uses Sphinx to auto-generate documentation. To build a new version of the documents offline into a formatted online manual, run `build-docs.bat` (for Windows) and `build_docs_no_check.sh` (for Unix/Linux) in the pre_scripts folder of the project. 


## Can I see some examples of current code?

You can find some examples [here](axiomapy/examples). In addition, the documents linked in the Documentation section, above, provide detailed annotated code examples in a compiled format.
