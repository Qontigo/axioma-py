# Contributing Guidelines

## Welcome!

Welcome to Axioma's axioma-py open-source project. We hope you will enjoy using axioma-py and perhaps even want to contribute to it. 



## What is axioma-py?



axioma-py is a Python software development kit (SDK) created for Axioma customers and partners. It is designed to make it easier for our clients who are python users to access and use Axioma's Axioma API. axioma-py allows our python-friendly clients to import data, perform complex risk and attribution analytics on that data, and generate reports or other output, just as they would if directly accessing our REST API.

This project has been specifically designed to let users of our analytics products process their data in the API and retrieve results using python rather than directly accessing the REST endpoints and JSONs. For those who are comfortable with python, axioma-py may provide a quicker and more convenient way of accessing and working with the REST API. We invite Axioma clients, associates, and, especially, anyone interested in creating or enhancing a Python interface for REST commands to take a look at what we've done so far, ask questions, and contribute to expanding axioma-py use cases. 

Currently, axioma-py makes it simpler for you to:

* Create, modify, and delete portfolios, portfolio groups, benchmarks, templates, entities, batches, market data sources, analysis definitions, and more.

* Run analyses, such as stress tests or coverage reports.

* Create multi-asset-class risk models and export model data for use in other products.

* Run multi-asset-class performance attribution.




## Contributing How Tos


**How do I ask a question, make a suggestion, report a problem, pitch an enhancement idea, file a bug, or contact someone?**
    
* At the top of the project is an **Issues** menu option. Click it to go to the Issues page and then click the **Add New Issue** button. An editing box will appear. You can use [Markdown editing commands](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (supported by Github) to format your issue, if you like. Or you can use HTML. Or even mix the two. If you need more immediate help, please send an email to: axioma-py-SCTeam@simcorp.com.  


**How do I submit a contribution?**   

* If you've never contributed to an open-source project before, you might want to first look at [How to Contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution) on Github. 

* When you're ready to get started, the usual workflow for this project involves downloading the **master** branch, then creating a branch offline from this existing branch. Put your work in your new branch. Then, when finished, check it in, and we'll review it. 

* We may post information about areas that we need help developing on our [Github Project Issues page](https://github.com/Qontigo/axioma-py/issues), but with this project we expect that most of our users will know what they want to develop and just build it. If you are in that latter group and want to contribute your improvement to the overall project you are welcome to upload your branch, but there is no requirement to do so.

* You are also invited to make suggestions for improvements you would like us to implement by adding bugs or improvement ideas on this  [Issues page](https://github.com/Qontigo/axioma-py/issues). 
   
 

## A Contribution Prerequisite: Submit a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

For code you write, determine who the copyright owner is. If you are employed in the US, it's likely that your employer can exert copyright ownership over your work, even if the work was not done during regular working hours or using the employer's equipment. Copyright law is highly variable from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Please consult your employer or a lawyer if you are not sure.

### *DCO to Use if the Copyright Owner is Yourself*

Please submit the following Developer Certificate of Origin Version 1.1 Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors. (See https://developercertificate.org/). If used, this must be submitted verbatim.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

**(a)** The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

**(b)** The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

**(c)** The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

**(d)** I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

### *DCO to Use if the Copyright Owner is Not Yourself*

If you've determined that the copyright holder for the code you write is some other entity (e.g. your employer), you must ensure that you are authorized by the copyright holder to be able to license this code under the Apache 2.0 license (see the License file in the root directory of this project) for the purpose of contribution to the axioma-py project. 

Please contact us at axioma-py-SCTeam@simcorp.com and we can assist you in the proper Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) or Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA).
