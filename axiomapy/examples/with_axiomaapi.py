# # Axioma API Direct Access
# 
# 
# All API access is managed through a series of modules and classes using the active session.
# 
# In some cases, direct API access may be preferred or necessary.  
# The following examples show how to access the API classes and perform some actions on portfolios.
# 

# ## Imports
# 
# The axioma-py imports.
# Each 'section' of the API is available to import from the Axioma API package.



from axiomapy import AxiomaSession, AxiomaResponse
from axiomapy.axiomaapi import (
    PortfoliosAPI,
    AnalysesPerformanceAPI,
    AnalysesRiskAPI,
    ClientEventBusAPI
)

# Some other imports



from pprint import pprint
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import logging
from axiomapy.session import APIType



logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, 
                    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s', 
                    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')


# ## Credentials and Creating an Active Session
# Load up some credentials to work with. There is a sample.credentials.json in the ./examples/credentials folder. Copy this file to credentials.json and update. Alternatively, skip the next set of code and set the credentials directly when creating the session:



from axiomapy.examples.load_credentials import get_user
user1 =  get_user('user1')




# If the credentials json is not used, enter credentials directly below:
AxiomaSession.use_session(user1['client_id'], user1['username'], user1['password'], user1['domain'], application_name='With analyses examples connection')
# Test the connection:
me = AxiomaSession.current.test()


# ## Get a List of Portfolios



portfolios_response = PortfoliosAPI.get_portfolios(top=10)


# The response object contains subsets of the original response.



print(f"Returned type is {type(portfolios_response)}")




pprint(portfolios_response.json())


# You can still access the original response.



original_response = portfolios_response.response


# However, the original response can be requested.



response = PortfoliosAPI.get_portfolios(top=10, return_response=True)

print(f"The returned type is {type(response)}")

print(f"Access the original request url info {response.request.url}")


### Performance Attribution Request

#A Performance Attribution request is used to analyze the performance of a portfolio over given dates.
#A prerequisite to the main PA task is to start a job to pre-calculate the analytics results that form the inputs to performance attribution.


precompute_param = {
    "asOfDate": "2021-03-31", 
    "benchmark": {"useNoBenchmark": True}, 
    "performanceAttributionSettingsId": 2136463,
    "computingBehavior":"MissingOnly"
}

analyses_test = AnalysesPerformanceAPI.post_precompute(portfolio_id=123330, precompute_parameters=precompute_param)


#Once the precompute task has run for all the dates for which the main PA task is to be performed, the PA task can be triggered.

#The PA task body accepts the start and end dates for a PA along with the Performance Attribution Settings ID.

pa_params = {
    "startDate": "2021-03-30", 
    "endDate": "2021-03-31",
    "benchmark": {"useNoBenchmark": True}, 
    "performanceAttributionSettingsId": 2136463,
    "computingBehavior":"MissingOnly"
}

#The header of the response to the request consists of the requestId, which can be used in additional requests.

pa_task = AnalysesPerformanceAPI.post_performance_analysis(portfolio_id=123330, analyses_parameters=pa_params)
requestId = int(pa_task.headers["location"].split("/")[-2])

#The status of the request and the logs can be attained using the request id:

status = AnalysesPerformanceAPI.get_status(request_id=requestId)
logs = AnalysesPerformanceAPI.get_logs(request_id=requestId)


## Risk Model Service

#The Risk Model Service is helpful in generating a risk model based on the exposures of a portfolio or list of instruments. 
#It can also be used to output factor returns for a given portfolio or list of instruments.


#Create a request with the desired parameters: portfolio or instruments, risk model definition, and statistic definition:

rms_parameters = {
  'portfolioId': 123442,
  'analysisDate': '2020-09-15',
  'riskModelDefinitionId': 3707082
}


#The header of the response to the request consists of the requestId, which is used in additional requests:

req = AnalysesRiskAPI.post_risk_model_request(risk_model_parameters=rms_parameters)
requestId = int(req.headers["location"].split("/")[-1])

#The status of the request can be fetched using the requestId. Once the request is completed the user can also access the logs for the same. 

status = AnalysesRiskAPI.get_risk_model_request_status(requestId)

logs = AnalysesRiskAPI.get_risk_model_logs(requestId)

#The user can get the results of the request using the requestId. The user can choose the results to be in raw format or refined by changing the parameter show_raw_results in the request.

results = AnalysesRiskAPI.get_risk_model_results(request_id=requestId, show_raw_results=False)

#The risk model data from the above step can also fetched in zipped format. 
headers={"Accept":"multipart/x-zip"}
raw_results = AnalysesRiskAPI.get_risk_model_results(request_id=requestId, headers=headers)

#This data can be extracted and saved to a local directory with a sample code below
import zipfile
from io import BytesIO
z = zipfile.ZipFile(BytesIO(raw_results.content))
for name in z.namelist():
    z.extract(name)
    
    
## Accessing CEB Endpoints

#The users can access the endpoints of Axioma Client Event Bus API using axioma-py. Below is an example to get a collection of market data events using the API

#Create a session to access Client Event Bus endpoints

AxiomaSession.use_session(
    username=user1['username'],
    password=user1['password'],
    domain=user1['domain'],
    api_type=APIType.CEB
)

market_data = ClientEventBusAPI.get_all_market_data()
pprint(market_data.json())
