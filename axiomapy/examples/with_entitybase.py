# # CommonBase, EntityBase, TemplatedEntityBase, Enumbase and Collections
# 
# The following examples illustrate the functionality and usage of the base classes in constructing classes to represent API entities.
# Unless contributing to the package, this should be considered for information only and is not required to follow any other examples.
# 
# 
# ## Overview
# 
# The goal of the axioma-py package is to provide a set of classes and associated methods to facilitate working with the Axioma REST API.
# The intended benefits and goals of this package are:  
# * To provide a more intuitive interface for users less familiar with the API to increase usage.  
# * To allow developers to work with json/dict representations interchangeably with instances where more convenient.  
# * To improve the developer's and API user's experience.  
# * To reduce dependency on external documentation.  
# * To package more boiler plate code to reduce time to build applications.  
# * To include comprehensive examples and tutorials on usage. 
# * To include examples/art to help business users leverage the API or better understand its benefits. 
# * To be easy to collaborate on.  
# 
# 
# The core functional requirements of the package are: 
# * To have classes that capture the models of the API  
# * To provide supported nested models.   
# * To move from the class instances to the dict representations passed or returned by the API and vice-versa seamlessly.  
# * To support core user requirements such as cloning, updating, etc..  
# * To provide a developer experience consistent with the language requirements, e.g. snake casing/PEP8, etc.  
# 
# A series of 'abstract' base classes are used to provide this core functionality and should be sub-classed when creating an API model class.
# 
# 
# ## Architecture/Design
# 
# The sdk design has 4 distinct elements:  
# 1. Session: Manages all http requests to the remote app and triggers serialization/deserialization. Leverages requests Session and so can use existing connection pools, etc..   
# 2. Context Manager: manages switching sessions between contexts (i.e. with blocks).  
# 3. axiomapy: Interface to the RESTful API via the current Session  
# 4. Entities: All the data models and methods associated with working with the remote resources. Any actions on resource resources are handled by the axiomapy classes  
# 
# For functional usage of the session/context refer to: [with_axiomaapi](./with_axiomaapi.ipynb)  
# For functional usage axiomapy refer to: [with_sessions](./with_sessions.ipynb)
# 
# The remainder of this notebook considers the entities.
# 
# There are various base classes and there are code examples of each below:  
# * EnumBase - provides features for enumerations such as creation from strings, case-insensitivity etc.
# 
# * CommonBase - Represents serializable classes that are also cloneable.  
#     * Used for classes that do not need to initialize directly from a response but should serialize as part of a request.   
#     * For example, used as a base class in collections where the collection is initialized from an iterable of representations rather than directly.
# 
# * EntityBase(CommonBase) - apart from collections, all classes subclass this abstract class.  
#     * Provides methods to serialize to and from dict.  
#     * Provides methods to update/replace contents. 
#     * Provides dict-like methods (get, update) and property/attribute access instance\['property'\], instance.property.  
#     * Interrogates the subclass property's type hints to manage nested entities and special data types when serializing.  
#     * Handles translation between datamodel naming conventions (camel case) to python/PEP8 (snake case).  
# 
# * TemplatedEntityBase(EntityBase) - used to represent entities that are presented via templates.  
#     * Supports an explicit mapping between class properties and the data model (template). 
#     * Supports direct access to the content attributes from the upper level class.  
# 
# * EntityCollectionBase - a common base class for collections of entities arguably redundant.  
# 
# * EntitySequence(MutableSequence\[T\], EntityCollectionBase) - Represents a non-keyed/mapped set of entities e.g. Identifiers.  
# 
# * EntityMapping(MutableMapping\[str, T\], EntityCollectionBase) - Represents a dict like mapping of entities e.g. Portfolios.  
# 
# Collections of entities could be managed reasonable easily with a simple list/dict but this would not support class methods
# However, since their value is not as great as other base classes they attempt to work interchangeably with list/tuple etc.
# 

# ## EnumBase
# 
# Provides a common base for defining enumerations. Create a sample here for following examples.  
# The EnumBase class allows case insensitive initialization and will serialize to JSON (required for sending to requests) though this should not be required.



from axiomapy.entitybase import EnumBase

class SampleEnum(EnumBase):
    Value1 = "Value1"
    Value2 = "Value2"




enum = SampleEnum('Value1')
enum = SampleEnum('value1')
enum = SampleEnum('VALUE1')

# access the value
enum.value




# The enum class does not serialize to json. The EnumBase is a subclass of String, so it will serialize json.
# Since the enum will be identified and converted explicitly this should be unnecessary.
import json
test = {"value": enum}
str_test = json.dumps(test)
str_test


# ## EntityBase
# 
# Used in the representation of an API model.  
# Rules for subclassing:
# * The model is reflected by the properties.  
# * Type hints on the property help the class serialize properties correctly.
# * All access to the datamodel must be managed through the class properties.
# * All properties must be able to accept None (or the default value in the __init__ function if not None)
# * Decorators on the properties enable extra hints for serialization to be passed from the model class.
# 
# 
# Create a sample class with properties of various types with the exception of those of type common base:

# ### Using the samples
# 
# Create an instance directly. 
# Translation of args to the __init__ method is performed by the camel_case_translate wrapper.


# only required args:
new_sample = SampleEntity(100)
# some optional args:
another_sample = SampleEntity(50, date_field_str="2020-05-10", enum_field=SampleEnum.Value2)
# camel case args:
camel_case_sample = SampleEntity(50, enumField="value1", dateFieldDate=date.today())


# Create an instance from a dict representation:

sample_from_dict = SampleEntity.from_dict(sample_entity_dict)



# Accessing Properties
# 
# Properties can be accessed via their camelCase or snake_case names.  
# They can also accessed as dictionary keys and also with the get() method.


print(f"new_sample has id: {new_sample.id}")
print(f"another_sample has date: {another_sample.date_field_str}")
print(f"another_sample date_field_str can also be accessed via dateFieldStr {another_sample.dateFieldStr}")
print(f"entities can be accessed in snakecase or camel case like a dict {another_sample['dateFieldStr']}"
      f" and with get method {another_sample.get('dateFieldStr')}")


# #### How the Accessor Methods Work
# 
# When getting or setting a property the class property is resolved using the _translate_to_class_prop() method.
# The translation is automatic, so the logic for translation exists on the base class.
# In the templatedEntity example the translation is class-specific.



print(f"date_field_datetime maps to prop: {SampleEntity._translate_to_class_prop('date_field_datetime')}")
print(f"dateFieldDatetime maps to prop: {EntityBase._translate_to_class_prop('dateFieldDatetime')}")


# ### Clone, Update, and Replace
# 
# #### Cloning
# 
# Cloning creates a new instance based on the object being cloned.
# A clone is performed by converting to and from a dict representation and updating from the source instance.



cloned_sample = sample_from_dict.clone()
print(f"The do_not_clone decorator on the id property means cloned_sample has an id of {cloned_sample.id}")
cloned_sample_2 = sample_from_dict.clone(enum_field="value2")
print(f"overrides can be applied when cloning, cloned_sample_2 has enum_field of {cloned_sample_2.enum_field}")


# #### Update 
# 
# Can update from a dict or from an instance. Works just like the dict method update.



print(f"cloned_sample.id before update {cloned_sample.id}")
cloned_sample.update({"id":100})
print(f"cloned_sample.id before update {cloned_sample.id}")
print("The full cloned_sample after update is:\n", cloned_sample_2)
cloned_sample_2.update(sample_from_dict)
print("The full cloned_sample_2 after update is:\n", cloned_sample_2)


# #### Replace
# 
# The replace method makes the calling instance the same as the argument entity.



cloned_sample_2.replace({"id":100})

print("After replacing the sample is:\n", cloned_sample_2)


# ### Serialization
# 
# Objects are serialized to a dict object which is valid to serialize to json (e.g., by requests)
# 
# Fields marked as do_not_serialize are ignored.
# 
# The to_dict() method has the following arguments:
# translate - output camelCase (otherwise snake_case)
# cloning - actions performed as part of cloning will check for do_not_clone decorator
# ignore_none - do not serialize properties with a value of None (i.e. those not set)



sample_to_serialize = SampleEntity.from_dict(sample_entity_dict)

print(sample_to_serialize.to_dict())
# for example, without translating:
print(sample_to_serialize.to_dict(translate=False))


# #### How Serialization Works
# 
# Only class properties are serialized. 
# Specific ways to treat properties are indicated by their return-type hints on the getter.
# Additional decorators add control.
# 
# There are a number of methods on the base class that show how the process works:



# Show the properties that can be considered for serialization:
class_props = SampleEntity.class_properties()
print(f"The set of properties are: {', '.join(class_props)}")


# The type of each property can be checked and then, based on its type, an action will be taken to prepare its value for serialization:

prop_type_enums = [f"prop: {prop} has type: {SampleEntity._get_prop_type(prop)}" for prop in class_props]

print(prop_type_enums)


# The following prop types are identified:
# * EnumType - will be converted as value.value
# * IterableEnumType - for each item converted as value.value
# * CommonBaseType - will call the to_dict() method
# * IterableCommonBaseType - for each item, will call the to_dict() method
# * DictOfCommonBase - for each item in values(), will call the to_dict() method
# * Date - will format to a str as yyyy-mm-dd using date_arg_fmt(value, format="%Y-%m-%d")
# * DateTime - will format to a str as yyyy-mm-ddT00:00:00 using date_arg_fmt(value, format="%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00")
# * OtherType - will return value unchanged

# ### Nested Entities
# 
# 
# When the prop type is associated with a common base, the entity of the property will itself be serialized.

# ## TemplatedEntityBase
# 
# Entities that are accessible via templates need extra logic to work as a classed-based instances.
# Instruments and Stats (View column/levels) use this base class.  
# 
# The key challenges are:   
# The data model is user-definable and does not need to follow any naming standards or conventions.  
# Types have to be determined at run time: for example, view columns.  
# The properties of interest are nested in the 'content' property but this would introduce a cumbersome 'middle' layer data model.   
# 
# 
# The TemplatedEntityBase class subclasses the EntityBase but defines class attributes for the template name and type and a custom to_dict()  
# method to serialize the properties into a 'content' property.
# 
#

# For the scope of instruments, the template type can be considered to be known via the user.
# In the case of view column stats, an unknown collection of stat templates may be associated with the view.
# Therefore, two distinct classes help create instances from dictionary. 
# * A generic stat exists in which the template name and content properties are set at run time. It allows property access but no intelligence.
# * A StatFactory is used to create a relevant instance based on the template name in the dict definition and will return a generic stat if required.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ## Generic Collections - Mapping and List
# 
# Some of the models define collections of entities: Portfolios, Positions, StatisticDefintions, Identifiers etc.
# 
# While lists of entities are equally supported, having collection-type base classes offers the opportunity to add some contextual methods.
# The primary benefit is to provide a to_dict and clone method directly (rather than iterating and applying on each entity) subclasses of CommonBase.
# A secondary benefit is specifically for mapping-type collections to offer the ability to reflect the application's mapping logic.
# As an example, AnalysisDefinitions have keys on a tuple of name, owner and team. Portfolios have keys on Name.
# 
# (see also [https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html])
# 
# Collections can receive dictionary or classes of the member instances.
# 
# 
# ### MutableSequence
# 
# Lists of entities that do not map to an identifier or a 'key'. Examples of these are Identifiers, Qualifiers.
# 
# 
# ### MutableMapping
# 
# A mapping (dict) type for entities that can be uniquely identified by some key e.g. Portfolios (name), AnalsysisDefinitions(name, owner, team), etc.. 
# The subclass defines how to create a unique key from the entity instance.
#
